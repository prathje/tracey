# Trace Yourself - It Could Be Easy
This repository contains our prototype for Tracey's NFC and QR-code based tracing implemented for Android OS.

**Disclaimer: This project is a proof of concept. The code as well as the concept are not suited for production use.**

## Overview of Tracey
Whenever two persons meet, they create an encounter-based secret.
In case of an infection, the infected party notifies all encounters using the individual secrets.
While a public database distributes those notifications, only the original parties receive them.
In addition to personal contacts, groups can also share a secret and 
The secrets can either be generated on demand or in advance.
